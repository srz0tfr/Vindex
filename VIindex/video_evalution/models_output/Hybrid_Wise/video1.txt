00:03 : SORTING- What is it?

+ Sorting is the process by which for given
scts of input. the outputs can be arranged in
increasing or decreasing order.

+ Any sequence S={s,5).........8,f can be
arranged into a new sequence

-8, } such that s,°<s,_,° for
n-!. by Sorting.

00:06 : SORTING NETWORKS-Az introduction
* Sorting networks are Comparison networks
that always sort their inputs.
* They comprise of Comparators and wires.
* Sorting networks implement Parallel
sorting.
+ Here input set is divided into two or more

subsets and are sorted parallely after which
they are merged into one output set.

A SORTING NETWORK

+ A Sorting network
consists of comparators
which takes in two
Inputs. x and y. and two
outpuls. x” andy”. that
performs the following
functions:

x =min(x.y)
y =max (x.y)

“Its importance in Sorting networks

+ Merging process is an important process in
Sorting Networks.

+ After parallel sorting of tvo subsets get
over, merging them into one single set is
essential which is accomplished by a special

purpose parallel architecture known as
Merging Network.

THE ZERO-ONE PRINCIPLE

THEOREM:

A comparator network with n inputs that sorts

all 2° sequences of

zeroes and ones is a

sorting network fie. it sorts all sequences of
arbitrary values, too).

PADMALEENA KABITA
00:21 : INFERENCE FROM THE PROOF:

* Thus \(f(a)) is unsorted or. in other words,
that the 0-1-sequence f(a) is not sorted by
ihe comparator network V.

+ If there is an arbitrary sequence « that is not
sorted by .V. then there is a 0-1-sequence
Ata) that is not sorted by V.

« Conversely. if all 0-1-sequences are sorted
by .V. then all arbitrary sequences are sorted
by V.

A BITONIC SORTING NETWORK

A Bitonic Sorting Network is a comparison
network that can sort any Bilonic scquence:
a sequence that cither monotonically
decreases and then monotonically increases
or the converse of it.

A bilonic sorter is comprised of several
stages. each of which is called a half-
cleaner.

If the input to a Half Cleaner 1s a Bitome Sequence
of Os and 1's, then the output. satisfies the
following properties: both the top half’ and the
bottom half are bitonie, every element in the top
half is at feast as small ay every element of the
bottom half and at least one half is clean.

00:36 : RANSPOSITION SORTING NETWORK
(Odd-Fven Mergesort)
+ This Algorithm is based on a merge
algorithm that merges two sorted halves of a
sequence to a completely sorted sequence.
This algorithm is not data-dependent. Le
the same comparisons are performed
regardless of the actual data.
Therefore. Odd-even mergesort can be
implemented as a sorting network.

00:39 : PERMUTATION NETWORK

+ A Permutation network on n inputs and n
outputs has switches that allow it to connect its
inputto its outputs according to any of the n!
possible permutations.

Ifwe replace each comparator ina __[ 2
sorting network with the switch of
the figure. the resulting network is
a permutation network.

00:42 : SHELLSORT SORTING NETWORK

+ The idea of Shellsort is the following:
(a) Arrange the data sequence in a two-
dimensional array
(b) Sort the columns of the array in a repeated
proces
* Shellsort can be implemented ay a sorting network

if the data-dependent Insertion Sort is replaced
with Bubble Sort.

00:45 : CONCLUSION...

¢ Sorting networks are the fastest known as
comparisons are performed in parallel.

+ This property of the Sorting networks is
implemented in various networks.which
increases its efficiency.
